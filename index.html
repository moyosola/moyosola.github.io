    <h5> The Problem </h5>
    <p> The problem I am addressing is the lack of human rights for women and those that are able to conceive due to America’s restrictions on abortion laws and mysognistic ideas. Below is a map that shows the contradictions on abortion rights in America. </p>

    <h6> Who is impacted?</h6>
    <p> Teen Mothers </p>
   <p> All Women </p>
    <p> People able to get pregnant </p>
    <p> Low-income and marginalized communities </p>
    </div>
<h6> What are some misconceptions about this cause? </h6>
    <p> ↳ Some people believe that because their religion don't support abortions it should be taken away from everyone. </p>
    <p> ↳ People who advocate for abortion laws wish to act carelessly with their bodies and not have to deal with a consequence of their actions. </p>
    <p> But this cause is not for any of that, it is a cause to give women and those able to get pregnant the power over their bodies. To give them the authority and respect they deserve. That is what this cause is.</p>
