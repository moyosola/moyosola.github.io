This is my Girl's Who Code project dedicated to a topic i'm very interested in. I started focusing on the abortion laws during school for a english research paper and i've found myself advocating for the cause ever since. This was a project I worked on myself and this is my first time coding so I'll improve the website as time passes and my skills improve!
